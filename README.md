# Udemy-Java-Bootcamp


These are all of the exercises I am doing as I follow along with [this Java Script Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/) I found on udemy 
(was actually a suggestion from a fellow student at Lambda School). Each exercises also usually has extensive notes since I tend to think in writing.
